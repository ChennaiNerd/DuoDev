Learning X in Y levels

### Description

We always start learning any programming language by learning the syntax.
To learn the syntax, we have to read more than 300 pages ebook or physical book.
Then we found out [http://learnxinyminutes.com/](Learning X in Y minutes).
It is really awesome. Sometimes, we feel bored in learning language's syntax.

Then we used [https://www.duolingo.com](duolingo) language learning platform.
We love it and ofcourse its design. We have idea of Duolingo for
computer language(only for syntax). That idea becomes [DuoDev](http://ufkk04cc7eb6.fizerkhan.koding.io/)
